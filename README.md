# Business-Website

This is the second website I created, after my first year at university, to practice my HTML, CSS and Javascript. It is a template for businesses which can be modified to show information related to themselves.

## Getting Started

To get a copy of the website download the respository as a zip file and extract it to a location of your choosing. Then open index.html in your browser to view the website or open any of the html, css or js files in a text editor to view the source code.

### Prerequisites

* A text editor for example [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* A web browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

## Built With

* [Atom](https://atom.io/) - The text editor used for programming
* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - The browser used to view the website
